# I Am Poor App Using Kotlin

Here, I made a simplest app, where it mainly uses two composable objects, a `Text` and an `Image`.

## Why I Made This

The title speaks itself, because I am poor.

Of course, money. I need a quick cash, so I can save for my dream car project.

## Inspiration

Inspired from Angela Yu's course, where the initial project is to build something simple. So, here it is, a simple project so I can discover more about Kotlin.

It's quite effective to learn about Kotlin by discovering functions and elements I never encounter.

## Thoughts

Honestly, I still don't understand how the `Modifier` really works. Especially the case when I added the `Text` and `Image` before using the `Column`.

I don't get why does the `Modifier.size` doesn't work, even I inserted the size in `5.dp` for the width and height.

The `Column` is kinda similar with the vertical `UIStackView` in Swift. But what lacks is on the `verticalAlignment`. 

It wants you to pick either the all components be at the center using `Arrangement.Center`, or make an automatic spacer between components using `Arrangement.spacedBy()`.

This is the opposite for the `UIStackView`, where you can manage it all in different menu.

I also don't get why do we need to separate the line of Preview and the executed one on the app. If I made a new component, I have to remind myself to not forget add the new component to the Preview code.

Importing a bunch of framework is still a thing in Kotlin. I thought they had a single framework that has everything on it, like `Foundation` in Swift, or the language itself has a various of variable or functions.

## Conclusions

Even though I think Kotlin has some absurd way to do it, I think it's not that annoying or tedious. I think it's kinda acceptable, cause the App has a smaller scope, after all.

I'll continue to learn Kotlin more. I think I'll try to build a simple dice roll, just like the second Angela's project.

Thanks for reading through until this line.
